Braille does not use the mscorlib binary shipped with .NET or mono. 

== Baseline corlib ==
In this repository, there is a project called Braille.Corlib.csproj. 
It is the baseline mscorlib implementation for Braille. 
It contains the parts that is needed to test all aspects of the braille transpiler.

You can build an application from just the baseline corlib, all tests under Braille.Tests are applications built this way.

== Mono based corlib ==
However, there is also a experimental Braille corlib based on the mono corlib sources in a fork tracking the official mono repository.
It can be found here: http://github.com/markusjohnsson/mono.git in the branch "braille"
